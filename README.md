# Movie Ratings Analysis  

## Overview  
This project analyzes movie ratings data using statistical and machine learning techniques. The goal is to explore the relationships between critic and audience ratings, identify key influencing factors, and develop a predictive model for movie ratings.  

## Dataset  
The dataset contains movie-related features such as:  
- **Tomatometer Ratings & Counts** (Critic reviews from Rotten Tomatoes)  
- **Audience Ratings & Counts** (Audience reviews from Rotten Tomatoes)  
- **Movie Attributes** (Genre, Runtime, Release Year, etc.)  

## Methodology  
This project follows the **CRISP-DM methodology**:  

### Milestone 1: Data Collection & EDA (Feb 5 - Feb 21, 2025)  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
  - Correlation matrix  
  - Histograms of numerical features  
  - Pairwise scatter plots  
  - Box plots for outlier detection  

### Milestone 2: Feature Engineering & Modeling (Feb 21 - Mar 21, 2025)  
- Feature selection & transformation  
- Building regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation  

### Milestone 3: Model Evaluation & Tool Development (Mar 24 - Apr 23, 2025)  
- Model performance evaluation (RMSE, RÂ², confidence intervals)  
- Development of an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit/Plotly Dash**  
- Final report and presentation
